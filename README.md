# Course-and-Records-Holder
Course & Records Holder (CRH) is a Java-based console application used to manage students, courses, enrollments, and grades.
It allows you to import and export data, create backups, and generate reports using Java Streams.
The system is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, useful design patterns, and modern Java features, making it a lightweight but powerful tool for handling academic records.
